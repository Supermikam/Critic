              <h1>Accessibility</h1>
              <p>The major problem of the website is lacking alternetives for images. 
                  In the project page, all the project preview images have no alternatives.
                  Arguably, this is not a big problem for this particular website, 
                  for the image itself is the content and the only content that matters here.
                  Even if all the images are provided with alternatives, it would not really help 
                  users using screen readers.  
              </p>
              
              <p>Another problem of the website is misusage of h tags. The animation page started with h3 tag, 
              a proper choice would be h2 tags since the page title is omitted and 
              the h3 tags are used for the title of the animations. 
              And the Marketing page used h2 tag for the title, which should be h1.

              <h1>Popularity</h1>
              <p>The website is not popular at all. This is also not a problem 
              because One to One Hundred is a company that only does business with other companies. 
              Their potential customers do not google for a rendering service provider. This is a highly
              profesionalized circle, and it is also a small circle. Their customers know their existance first
              from other chanels and then go on to the website and check out their previous works.

              <h1>SEO</h1>
              <p>On SEO Analyzers, the website rated 64 out of 100. Not bad!
              Actually, all that is required of the website is that when people search their
              name, the website should be the first one on the search result. It is. 
              Thanks to their special name mainly, but it is a hard evident of the website doing a good job on SEO.
